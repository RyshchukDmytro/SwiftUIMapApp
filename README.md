This is a simple map application where I utilized prerecorded data to display several spots on the map. The app demonstrates basic map integration, data visualization, and user interaction with map annotations.

**Features**
* Displays multiple locations on the map using prerecorded data.
* Interactive map annotations for better user experience.

Below are some screenshots of the app in action:
